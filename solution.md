# Project Purple Cow

This solution uses Node and Express to serve
an HTML page which then include JavaScript and
CSS files.

If you have Node installed already, you can run
`npm install` to install the required packages and 
`node app.js` to run the app. Open http://localhost:3000/ in
Chrome to view the app.
